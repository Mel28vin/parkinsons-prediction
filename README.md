> A ML Project showcasing the efficiency of various learning algorithms for Parkinson's disease Prediction

Parkinson's disease is a crippling neurological condition that impairs mobility and makes people stiff and tremble. Since there is no cure or effective medication for severe stages of the disease, early discovery of the condition is essential for its appropriate management and treatment as late identification may lead to death. Currently, it is predicted by imaging techniques and clinical assessments which may lead to misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of Parkinson's disease, especially in its early stages due to abnormalities and variability in clinical data. Machine learning based Learning classification algorithms can play an vital role in the prediction of Parkinson's in its early stages. This project shows a framework for the classification and prediction of Parkinsonâ€™s disease by using a range of biomedical voice measurements for accurate diagnosis by highly tuned classification algorithms. Experimental testing proves the efficacy of the proposed framework.
